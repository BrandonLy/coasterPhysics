        <h3 class="focusTitle">Forces</h3>
        <p class="focusParagraph">Centripetal force describes the pull of an object towards the center of a round object. On roller coasters, the infamous loops are great examples of where we might see this in real life. The cart moves along the rails and seemingly defies gravity as it completes a full circle. One might expect the cart to either fall off or simply keep going, resisting the track's attempts to keep it on course. We can all thank this interesting force for making these thrilling paths possible.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>The equation for centripetal force is modeled by F<sub>c</sub> = mv<sup>2</sup>/r. The F represents force, the m mass, v velocity, and r the radius of the circular path. Not only does Centripetal Force have its own equation for force, there is also an equation for calculating centripetal acceleration, which can be modeled by a<sub>c</sub> = v<sup>2</sup>/r.This force plays an important role in many different parts of life. The most important thing that centripetal force does for us would have to be preventing objects from flying all willy-nilly. Imagine a world where the moon didn't orbit the Earth, the Earth didn't orbit the Sun, the sun didn't have an orbit in our solar system. We wouldn't be alive today. Speaking of the moon, back in the 1600's Sir Isaac Newton had plenty of time to think about the moon and Earth's relationship. He figured that some force must be acting upon it in order to prevent it from traveling away. This was the beginning work on centripetal force.</p>
            <p>Now, clearly the technology exists to make insanely fast roller coasters. So why don't we? The main reason is that speed does not always create a better ride. Typically people like the "weightlessness" associated with riding. The credit for this feeling can be credited to the normal forces on a coaster changing. Now to understand why, it's important to understand how normal force works.</p>
            <p>Normal force is the force applied to an object by a surface. A very basic example involves a person standing still. The two forces acting upon them are normal and gravity. Gravity is causing the person to accelerate towards Earth, while the Earth is pushing back on the person. This force is exactly the same amount as the gravitational pull on the person. This phenomenom is normal force.</p>
            <p>So on a roller coaster, the cart and tracks supply the normal force for the riders. As the riders reach the peak of the loop, they are upside down. Gravity also pulls straight down, nothing unusual about that. However, out of the ordinary is the direction the normal force is being applied. We often associate normal force with always facing upwards, because most of our surfaces are flat and horizontal, but normal force is always perpendicular to the surface. So when a person is upside down, the Normal Force and Gravity are acting in the same direction. This results in a perceived decreased weight. The inverse applies when a person has reached the bottom of the roller coaster.</p>

        <h3 class="focusTitle">Energy</h3>
        <p class="focusParagraph">Energy is present all around us. It's there when we're riding in a car or riding a coaster. It can take on many different forms and affect us in a large range of ways. Roller coasters demonstrate the change between what energy we can utilize and the energy we are currently making use of beautifully. In it we can see how at each point during the ride a different level of energy is being exerted, in addition to the countless trials and errors coming together to make a passable loop.</p>

            <p>In physics, there's this thing known as the conservation of energy. The basic principle is that although energy may change forms and transpose different mediums, it will always be there. It's kind of like matter where it will never be destroyed, only changed. You may have heard of potential energy, or the energy that an object possesses, allowing it to do work. Here we are going to discuss it in terms of <i>mgh</i> or mass times gravity times height.</p>
            <p>If you take a look at a roller coaster's loop, you might notice it isn't a perfect circle. The upside down tear shape is actually known as a clothoid. This shape is special because of the difference in radius at the top and bottom. This interesting concept wasn't the first choice for designers. Initially they chose to use perfect circles. However, over time, a multitude of problems arose. If the riders weren't launched at high enough speeds they would fall off the track as they became inverted. Seems like a simple solution. Just make them go faster right? Wrong. In order to reach a high enough speed to complete the loop, the forces would become beyond a safe limit. The designers consistently found that their riders were becoming injured.</p>
            <p>The energy present on a coaster comes in a variety of different forms. It would technically be classified as a mechanical energy simply because there are a variety of different moving parts. However, gravitational and heat energy are both present. The gravitational energy comes from Earth's gravitational pull on the coaster. The heat energy comes from the friction between the tracks and wheels. The heat energy is minimal because wheels and on a smooth surface don't tend to have a large frictional coefficient.</p>

        <h3 class="focusTitle">Acceleration</h3>
        <p class="focusParagraph">Acceleration is a unique topic. Most people would just associate acceleration with an increase of speed. However, the general assumption would be largely incorrect. Acceleration is refers to a change in velocity rather than a change in speed. This might seem like a distinction without a difference, but there is actually a crucial difference.

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>The difference between speed and velocity is that velocity includes direction in speed. Acceleration is a change in velocity. So if an object is moving in a circular path at a constant speed, is it accelerating? It is because the direction is constantly changing the entire time. This acceleration towards the center is described up above as centripetal force.</p>
            <p>The acceleration during a change on altitude is also unique. There's a special measure for gravity that we call G's. G is the force of gravity here on Earth at sea level. So we measure gravity in other places based on how you feel in relation to what you would feel. One G is equivalent to an acceleration rate of 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>. As you are going up and down in altitude quickly your inertia is causing you to feel as though the force of gravity has changed, even though it is a static force.</p>

        <p class="focusParagraph">You may be asking yourself, "Where did all these numbers come from? I thought this was math.". You wouldn't be alone in doing so. Click below to try an experiment to find these numbers for yourself!</p>

        <div class="accordion-title closed">Finding your master equation...
            <div class="showhide">[+]</div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>We went over the equation for centripetal force earlier. But how exactly did we come back that equation? There a whole variety of things that centripetal force applies to, but in order to find the equation you need to be able to exert control over your variables. Here we'll walk you through how to find the equation using a whirly gig. For this experiment you'll need:
            <ul class="materials">
                <li>A PVC pipe</li>
                <li>A rope or fishing line</li>
                <li>A tennis ball</li>
                <li>A meter stick</li>
                <li>A timer</li>
                <li>A set of masses, none of which exceeding about 1kg</li>
                <li>And most importantly, some importance</li>
            </ul> In this case your dependent variable is the force of tension. The independent variables alternate between velocity, radius, and mass. There are going to be trials that you are going to be going through, each time recording a minimum of five data points in tabular form. After you done with your table, make sure to graph your points and linearize any lines if possible.</p>
            <p>A whirly gig should have the rope run through the pvc pipe. The tennis ball should be attached to one end of the rope. This side is what we're going to refer to as the top. On the other side, you want to have a nut tied to the rope. It should be big enough to prevent the rope from coming out of the other side of the pvc pipe. This side is going to be the bottom.</p>
            <h4 class="subcategory">Trial One</h4>
            <ol class="procedures">
                <li>Measure how long the rope is when there's about one cm of rope left on the bottom</li>
                <li>Select a mass and attach it the bottom of the whirly gig</li>
                <li>Start to swing the whirly gig so that the tennis ball makes a nice consistent loop around the pipe</li>
                <li>You should be swinging the whirly gig fast enough to get the nut about a cm away from the bottom of the pvc pipe</li>
                <li>Using the timer, measure how long it takes for the tennis ball to make twenty revolutions</li>
                <li>Multiply the radius of the whirly gig, so the length you measured earlier, by 2πr, and then divide by the time you just recorded</li>
                <li>The mass on the bottom of the whirly gig times gravity (altogether this is the force of tension) goes in the right column of your table</li>
                <li>The velocity you calculated above goes in the right column</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2-8 until you have five data points</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="subcategory">Trial Two</h4>
            <ol class="procedures">
                <li>Same as step one above</li>
                <li>Same as step two above</li>
                <li>This time you want to keep your radius and velocity constant</li>
                <li>Select a mass to attach to the top of the whirly gig near the tennis ball</li>
                <li>Spin the whirly gig at a constant velocity until you reach that one cm gap, this will now be your velocity for the remainder of the trial</li>
                <li>After each data point that you collect, you should switch the mass on the bottom of the whirly gig</li>
                <li>Pick a new mass to attach to the top of the whirly gig that will allow you to spin it at that same velocity and reach taht one cm gap</li>
                <li>Repeat steps three through seven until you have five data points</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="subcategory">Trial Three</h4>
            <ol class="procedures">
                <li>For this trial your independent variable will be the radius, the dependent variable will be the force of tension, and the control will be the mass.</li>
                <li>Select a mass that will remain the same for this trial and attach it near the tennis ball</li>
                <li>Attach a weight to bottom of the whirly gig</li>
                <li>Spin the whirly gig at a constant velocity until the mass stops moving downwards or upwards</li>
                <li>Measure the radius on top, this goes in left column of your table</li>
                <li>Pick a new mass</li>
                <li>Repeat steps two through 6 until you have five data points</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now that you have all of these data points, what do you do with them? The best thing to do in this situation is to graph each of your data points. Remember that your independent variable goes on the x-axis and the dependent variable goes on the y-axis. As you are graphing the different data sets, keep in mind the shapes that you are seeing. Are they curved? Are they straight? Are they inverse? Its important that you linearize your graphs afterwards. Pay attention to the parent graphs. If the graph is one of ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c make sure that you square the x variables as you are making a linear graph. It's also very important that you actually graph the adjusted results to make sure it is in fact a straight line. Write down how the force of tension is proportional to each of the variables we tested earlier.</p>
            <p>If you did this correctly you should have found that F<sub>T</sub> is directly proportional to mass, proportional to velocity square, and inversely proportional to the radius squared. If you were to put all of these into one equation, you would find the equation for centripetal force. Where a physicist might spend hours manipulating numbers and variables in order to develop a proof, you took three graphs and found the same result.</p>
